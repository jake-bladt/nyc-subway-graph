# NYC Subway Graph

The purpose of this project is to scrape the MTA website for information about the current stations and lines, to represent those as a graph, and to store that graph in neo4j.

## Source

All of the information needed to build the graph should be available by scraping the links [here](http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/index.html).
